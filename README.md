# Conclusion/Recommendation:
The management should ensure that adequate personnel are available on Fridays to process Customers orders and discourage employees
going off-duty on Fridays with incentives.

Also there is need to understand their Customers diet and decide whether to continue offering 'The Big Meat' Pizza.

There is the need to critically investigate Revenue trend between the month of July(Peak) to October(Slump) to understand the 
root cause of the trend.Likewise November to December.
